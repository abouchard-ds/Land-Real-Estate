Data Analysis for Land Purchase

I want to buy land in the boreal forest. So I made a scraper to get me the data, then a data cleaner. Then I do some data analysis on the properties with statistics, business analytics and machine learning. 

## Web scraper

I started with my usual `bs4`, but could not get the page to switch because there are no page numbers in the URL of the website. So I had to learn `Selenium` from scratch. First I wanted to use `Selenium` only for page switching thus reusing what I already developed but the `driver.page_source` method seems to truncate the page and I consistently got only 12 results instead of the 20 per pages I was suposed to get.
